						<p id="blurb">These are my most recent works. They are either acrylic or oil mediums. The top
							three are
							painted on
							blocks of wood that I recycled from my taekwondo black belt graduation. That's right, you
							heard me.
							The boards were broken by my foot and fist. Double the sentiment.
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<i>Series 1: Snow</i>
							<br>
							This is the first of a three painting series based off of this little character.
							His name is Sooch (pronounced like it looks!). Each painting has a different color
							scheme and nature scene. I started with a basic sketch on the wood, and went layer
							by layer. The paint soaked into the wood more than I expected, so I always put
							down a heavy base coat before I added shading and details.

							Ah, Sooch looks very happy here. I wanted to work with warmer and richer
							colors for this second painting. The greens and details of the forest
							were a <i>lot</i> of fun to work with. Look at his little hat! My ideas for
							these paintings came straight out of my head, so the process of painting
							this one is exactly like <i>Snow</i>.

							<i>&Ouml;sterreich</i>
							<br>
							My first exposure to oil painting! It took hours upon hours. The scene did not come
							from my imagination like the others. It was based off a photo a family member had
							taken in Austria. My style is not as prominent in this one as it's based off nature,
							but I'm proud of my effort. This was a learning experience. I learned that for oil
							painting, I had to stand back every once and awhile to look at the canvas from a
							distance. I was thrown off by this, as I'm very detail oriented, but this method
							really assisted me in painting the mountains in the distance.

							<i>Rochester and Irving in the Library</i>
							<br>
							In 2017, I had a lofty goal to illustrate scenes for a book I was
							writing about animals living in Victorian times. Sadly the book
							never took off, but I was left with art from many potential scenes. I
							first sketched it in my own writing journal and then traced over
							it with my tablet. The colors are dark and rich, and I created
							this little library for myself. In summer 2019, I recreated this
							picture in oil paint. Detail work is much easier digitally than with

							<i>Ice Elves</i>

							Oh goodness, I'll admit it. I wrote Lord of the Rings fan-fiction back
							in 2015. This was one of the many scenes I drew for my book published
							online. I began with a brief sketch on my tablet before I started shading
							and filling in colors. Since I don't normally draw people, the figures
							(elves, my bad) were the hardest part to draw. Here they are traipsing
							through snow in a mountain valley.

							<i>Icarus</i>
							<br>
							My senior year literature class assigned a project where we had to
							choose a Greek myth and create anything to portray the myth in a
							different medium. I chose Icarus, the man with wax wings who flew
							too close to the sun. I first drew his body on paper before I took
							a picture of it and traced it on my tablet. I then filled in the
							sky and ocean. His wings are black compared to his father (flying
							beneath him) since he disobeyed orders and flew too close to the
							sun, and he has a chain on his ankle. I attempted to hide lots of
							symbolism in this rendition.

							elements of our exhibits. I also came up with images and visualizations of how the exhibit
							would look and feel.

							The theme was ice and the game had to be finished in three months, so my team of 5 banded
							together to create a visual novel game.
							The story forces you to make decisions and choose based off your morals.

							My group concepted many ideas and met frequently, and we all created the script
							and story collaboratively. Amazingly each one of us specialized in something
							different. I was in charge of background art (two pieces are shown above), one of my
							teammates was in charge
							of creating a soundtrack, one of character artwork, and two others teamed up with
							UI and coded it in Unity. I'm really proud of what we acheived in such a short amount of

							<i><b>The Journey Into Jon</b></i>
							<br>
							<br>
							My first taste of 3D animation. In Spring 2019, I took Introduction to Programming Through
							Animation.
							This project took 15 hours to animate. Those 15 hours were full of frustrations, overheating
							laptops,
							and lots of storyboarding. It was my final project and I won 5 categories of the "Oscars" my
							class held,
							as well as overall best film. Based off Garfield the cat, this story takes you on a twisted
							journey
							into the crazed mind of Jon, Garfield's owner. Very dark, very weird, with very old computer
							graphics.
							Take a look if you dare.

							This <i>exact</i> website you're on was coded by yours truly. I made it scroll organically,

							close, you can see all the details I added. Like I said, I love adding details. It makes it
							special and authentically me. This website took weeks to flesh out and code, and I wanted to
							make sure it works on
							mobile and on desktop. I also included links to my midterm and final site I coded for my
							Introduction
							to Web Development class.
